# oddments

![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/dkidney/oddments.svg?branch=master)

The oddments package is where I keep various functions that I have found
and one time or another but which dont really fit in any of my other
repositories.

## Installation

``` r
# release version
devtools::install_github("dkidney/oddments")
