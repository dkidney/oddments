# oddments

![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/dkidney/oddments.svg?branch=develop)

The oddments package is where I keep various functions that Iâ€™ve found
useful at one time or another but which dont really fit in any of my
other repositories.

## Installation

You can install oddments from
[Github](https://www.github.com/dkidney/oddments) with:

``` r
# release version
devtools::install_github("dkidney/oddments")

# development version
devtools::install_github("dkidney/oddments", ref = "develop")
```
