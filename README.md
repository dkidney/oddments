The `oddments` package contains various functions that I’ve found useful
at one time or another but which don’t really fit in any of my other
packages/repos.

## Installation

You can install oddments from
[Github](https://www.github.com/dkidney/oddments) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace('remotes')) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dkidney/oddments@v0.1.0")
```
