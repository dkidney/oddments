The `oddments` package contains various functions that I've found useful at one time or
another but which don't really fit in any of my other packages/repos.
    
## Installation

You can install oddments from [Github](https://www.github.com/dkidney/oddments) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace('remotes')) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dkidney/oddments@v0.1.0")
```
